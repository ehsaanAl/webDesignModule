            <p class="contents"> Where did Amour Start? <br> <br> Amour was brought to life by four students in a small classroom at the University of Westminster. It was orignially a coursework project to acheive credits for their modules, but soon the passion for the brand grew after ther graduation. The once students then made the decision to take the brand to new heights and give birth to the newest movement in high-street fashion. <br> <br> Amour is now a fully established brand reconised amongst other popular name brands you may have heard of - we are known to be ethical in terms of sourcing our matierals and labour, yet provide no compromise in our garment quality</p>
